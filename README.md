# comp230 - Ethics Essay Proposal

###Which ethical and professional challenges are prominent?  
* Violence in wii games/kinect/movement tracking tracking games
* Is it ethical to develop games that make the players act out violent acts??
* Specifically the control systems and how they reflect the violent act being performed?  (Manhunt wii)


###How professionals can conduct themselves in an ethical manner?
* How realistic the game looks?
* What the player is shooting at?
* Does it actually effect the player?
* How closely the control movement reflects the action

The ethical issue I intend to look at is video games violence and it's effect on the players aggression levels specifically in games that use motion tracking to make the player perform the violent acts, for example pressing a button to shoot compared to using a wiimote with a gun controller to shoot. In VR the player will see the a gun in their hand and will be acting out the game violence, the essay will research whether acting out violence in video games has an effect on real life agression levels.
