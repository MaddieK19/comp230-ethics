\section*{Topic}
The issue I intend to look at is the effect of video game violence on the players aggression levels when the player is using motion controls. Motion controls can make the player mimic violent acts rather than just press a button on a controller, this can increase immersion but I want to look at whether that increases aggression levels.

	\item[Comments:] Not a very helpful paper as it's more about Wiimote accuracy. But does Wiimote increases neo-immersion and promotes more intuitive interaction with the game.
