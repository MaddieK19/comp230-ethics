\section{Introduction}
The effects of violent video games on real life aggression is a commonly addressed subject and one that appears often in the media....


\section{Violent Video Games and Player Aggression}
 
Modern video games have vastly improved graphics compared to graphics from games years ago. Fumhe says there is also an increase in the amount of violent content in commercial video games. \cite{Fumhe} The improvement in graphics means that in game violence looks more realistic than in previous generations and is likely more immersive. 

\bigskip
Different studies define violence in different ways. The issue is with how the in game violence is viewed and whether it is ethical. For example an absolutist would say murder is wrong under any circumstance. \cite{forsyth}
Yet video game violence is a pretence, none of it is a real and the player is not harming anyone. \cite{Tavinor}
This raises the issue of whether video game violence should be viewed in the same way as real violence. Motion controls complicate this further as the player is physically acting out the violence to cause harm to a virtual character. 

\bigskip
There are many previous studies that have looked at the effects of video game violence and aggression. For example Sherry found that video games do increase player's aggression levels. However this rise is smaller than the effect of seeing violence on television.  \cite{sherry2001effects}
The rise in aggression is also short term from when the player starts playing a game. This implies that the rise in aggression fades. Even though video games can cause an increase in aggression this does not necessarily translate into aggressive behaviours.  \cite{Ferguson}

\section{Motion controls in video games}
Motion controls are control systems that record the players movement and translate it into and an in game action. Motion controls are often either using kinesic natural mapping which captures the players movement without and controllers or incomplete tangible natural mapping which requires a physical object such as the Wiimote to capture the players movement.  \cite{McEwan2012}
These can both provide more intuitive and interactive controls however, they require the user to mimic real life action including violent ones. \cite{Kim} 




\bigskip
The motion controls of the Wii lead to similar devices on other platforms, the PlayStation Move which uses wands 
like the Wii and the XBox Kinect which requires not controllers and uses a camera to record the players movement.
This technology continues to evolve, with the recent developments in VR come new controllers again that use motion controllers. 
\bigskip
Improvements in technology means that video games continue to get more realistic, graphics and sound have been continually improving increasing the players immersion in the game \cite{Kim}. Recently advances in VR has lead to new ways to control games most of these using motion controls... fully immersed...
 \bigskip

McArthur suggests that users may not want full immersion but instead "neo-immersion". \cite{McArthur} Whitson describes immersion in games as loss of  self, social and game awarenesses, in contrast Neo-Immersion focuses on those three factors. \cite{Whitson} Wii Sports is a game released with the Wii that uses movement controls using a Wiimote, Whitson suggests that this game is not trying to fully immerse the player they are likely to be playing it with friends and family. However as this is only one game of many released on the Wii platform this idea can not be applied to them all. 
This suggests that while motion controls make the game more interactive it also make it more social...

Another point.... is how well an action is translated from reality into a game  - link to Wiimote accuracy
Przybylski et al \cite{przybylski} bad controls cause frustration / aggression? link to competence
E.G real gun experience paper - if player has used a real gun there may be differences using wiimote
\bigskip
In theory games using motion controls are more intuitive as they use movement player already knows however could be small differences 
\bigskip
“Competence-impeding gaming experiences have the potential to aggravate and demotivate players”  Przybylski et al \cite{przybylski}

McArthur \textit{et al}  found that the Wiimote accessory that held the closest resemblance to a gun had the highest error rate. However, there was another controller that was shaped similar to a gun that had the lowest error rate. \cite{McArthur}

Frustration – aggression hypothesis people get aggressive when something is blocking there goal - \cite{dollard1939frustration}   

Realistic controllers \cite{McGloin}

VR  Sherry saying video games blamed for violence like TV used to be
