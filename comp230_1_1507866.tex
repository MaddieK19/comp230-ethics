\abstract{The intention of this essay is look at the effects of video game violence on aggression levels, specifically when the games use motion controls to make the player act out in game violence. It will also look at whether it is ethical for players to act these violent acts in game and whether it's ethical for game developers to make them.}
	
\section{Introduction}
The effects of violent video games on real life aggression is a commonly addressed subject and one that appears often in the media. 

\section{Violence in video games}
 
Modern video games have vastly improved graphics compared to graphics from games years ago. \cite{Caranagey} This improvement means that in game violence looks vastly more realistic ...

Kim defines immersion as "a psychological state or  subjective  perception  in which  even   though   part   or   all   of   an   individual’s   current   experience  is  generated  by  and/or  filtered  through  human-made  technology,  part  or  all  of  the  individual’s  perception  fails  to  accurately   acknowledge   the   role   of   the   technology   in   the   experience" \cite{Kim}.


One issue is what can be defined as violence in a video game from a ethical stand point an absolutist would say murder is wrong under any circumstance. \cite{forsyth1980taxonomy} However all of the violence in video games is a pretence, none of it is a real and the player is not harming or killing anyone. \cite{Tavinor} This raises of the issue of whether video game violence should be viewed in the same way as real violence. Motion controllers .... actioning out violence with intention to kill on screen NPC??

This relates to motion controls are often the player is mimicking the violent act and seeing the reaction on screen...


Realistic controllers \cite{McGloin}

\section{Motion controls in video games}
Motion controls are control systems that either use a motion wand of track the players movement and translate that movement into an in game action. This can provide more intuitive and interactive controls but require the user to mimic real life action including violent ones. \cite{Kim} The Wiimote motion controller even has accessories to make it look like a gun.

The motion controls of the Wii lead to similar devices on other platforms, the PlayStation Move which uses wands 
like the Wii and the XBox kinect which requires not controllers and uses a camera to record the players movement.
This technology continues to evolve, with the recent developments in VR come new controllers again that use motion controllers. 

Improvements in technology means that video games continue to get more realistic, graphics and sound have been continually improving increasing the players immersion in the game \cite{Kim}. Recently advances in VR has lead to new ways to control games most of these using motion controls... fully immersed...
 
Motion controls make game more immersive .... more immersion more violence ...


McArthur suggests that users may not want full immersion but instead "neo-immersion". \cite{McArthur} Whitson describes immersion in games as loss of  self, social and game awarenesses, in contrast Neo-Immersion focuses on those three factors. \cite{Whitson} Wii Sports is a game released with the Wii that uses movement controls using a Wiimote, Whitson suggests that this game is not trying to fully immerse the player they are likely to be playing it with friends and family. However as this is only one game of many released on the Wii platform this idea can not be applied to them all. 
This suggests that while motion controls make the game more interactive it also make it more social...
